# Nude.js (express-nude)

Your nudes are safe with Nude.js. 

This package offers convenient options to safely find nude parameters in your Express API requests. In just a few lines of code defining what to expect from an HTTP request's (`headers`, `query` or `body`), Nude.js will return back if the client side is missing any of the required parameters.
